This program can track a tennis ball on video, and provide insight about the ball's motion back to the user. Uses OpenCV.

As a competitive tennis player, I thought it would be really interesting to be able to analyze my tennis with Computer Vision - this is the first step to doing that. It is able to track the speed of a tennis ball on video. Currently only supports webcam, but in future I'm aiming to have it support tennis match clips (where the ball is much further away and moving faster).
